      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>I have many projects featured in this portfolio website! These projects range from quick prototypes to my big programming projects to some things I made to solve immediate problems, that are maybe not the most polished. These include projects from Help Desk, as well as a few from outside of the class!</p>
      <p style="text-align: center">See these projects <a href="/projects">here!</a></p>

      <h3>Journal Entries</h3>
      <p>During Help Desk, we completed some journal entries! These are just things I have written about relevant current events that I would like to share! There aren't any there yet, but there will be 4 by the end of the year!</p>
